# Bootstrap + JQuery Cycle + Responsive Design

This a simple way to integrate JQuery Cycle with Responsive design, its designed for bootstrap but the resizing will work on other percentage based grids. it resizes on desktop and mobile (device rotates). This is my first repo meant for public distribution. Just let me know if you find it useful :) 

The documentation is contained in the pages below.

Note: Pagers are a bit trickier and will require a lot of height hacking.
